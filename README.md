# travelLandingPage

Hello everyone,

  The purpose of this project was to help develop my skills in HTML and CSS. 
The original design for this landing page was created by MD Khaled. 
You can find MD Khaled's design at https://www.uplabs.com/posts/travel-login-form. 

Along with the landing page, I decided to design two additional pages. One for creating a new account 
and a "Forgot my password" page. 

This was strictly a front end development project. So, no accounts can actually be created or fetched.
